To start creating an issue, go to the repository, access the `Issues` tab and press “New issue”. 

From there, you can first give the issue a short title. Good issue titles briefly explain a problem/feedback so that other contributors/editors can quickly understand the context of the full issue message. 

After writing a title, you can write the body of the issue. When writing the issue message, please provide as much information as possible:
* Topic, website page, … that was affected or is being represented;
* Clearly and briefly describe the problem or feedback;
* If possible, propose a solution or change.

Anyone is free to discuss or recommend solutions to issues via the comment section.

To submit a change, you must have knowledge GitHub pull requests (PR) work.

Changes can be contributed in two ways:
* Directly modifying the file in the GitHub repository via the file `Edit` button, which facilitates creating a PR.
* Pull the repository code, create a separate repository branch, perform the changes, and contribute these changes as a PR between the created branch and the `main` branch.

PRs preferably should address previously created issue, whether these are by the same author of the PR or another, in order to logically connect feedback/issue reports and changes.

For the PR message, it should address the following topics:
* Topic, website page, etc. that was affected or is being represented;
