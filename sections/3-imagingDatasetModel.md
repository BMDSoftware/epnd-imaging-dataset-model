# Imaging Dataset Model - V1.0

After deliberation discussed in the prior section, we have defined a version 1.0 of the imaging model. Attached below is the model and it's properties:

This proposed model is meant to be as simple as possible, without resorting to more elaborate mappings of models such as openMINDS, etc.
