This document defines version v1.0 of the Imaging Dataset Model for use in the EPND project. The development of this version of the model comes from analysis of the current field usage of the EMIF-AD questionnaire in the EMIF Catalogue, along with an analysis of contemporary imaging models.

This initial version defines a baseline collection of attributes for the model that are:

* General DCAT-related properties;
* Imaging-related properties.
