The DCAT Vocabulary is an RDF Vocabulary that works with dataset catalogues. Each specified class and properties are vague and data-agnostic, allowing a large flexibility in implementation.

This document specifies an implementation of DCAT in order to create an imaging dataset model for the European Platform for Neurodegenerative Diseases project (EPND), aptly named Imaging Dataset Model.

A general rundown of the DCAT Vocabulary is provided for readers, along with an analysis and consideration of EMIF-AD fields and other existing imaging models. A justification is provided for the currently proposed version of the Imaging Dataset Model, and this itself is presented in a final section, with general DCAT-related fields and more specific imaging-related fields.
